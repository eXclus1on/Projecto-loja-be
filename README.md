# BE Project briefing

## Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to develop a full-stack web application for an online store. The application will include both frontend and backend components, with a particular focus on the backend development.
The web store will allow users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and complete the purchase process.

## Key features
### Product Catalog:
Develop a product catalog where users can view available products, along with details such as name, description, price, and images.

### Shopping Cart:
Implement a shopping cart feature that allows users to add products, update quantities, and remove items before proceeding to checkout. The shopping cart should be stored in a database so the users can pick it up and continue their purchase later.

### Checkout Process:
Develop a mock checkout process that guides users through entering shipping and payment information, and completing the purchase. No payment methods are needed the only payment method available can be “Payment on delivery”

### Order Management:
Create functionality for users to view their order history and track the status of their orders.

## Bonus features
### User Authentication: 
Implement user authentication functionality to allow users to create accounts, login, and logout.

### Admin Panel:
Implement an admin panel where authorised users can manage products, orders, and user accounts. Admins should be able to add, edit, and delete products, view and manage orders, and manage user accounts.
